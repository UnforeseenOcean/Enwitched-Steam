#Enwitched - A GUI frontend for Steam-Idle

A little app for idling with ease in Steam Client

100% Hackable, 100% free

Easy to use, type-and-go idler client

This is Enwitched, an frontend made just for doing idling jobs with Steam-Idle.

Follow the steps inside and you'll be idling in games with ease.

Low power & no GPU power required (except for displaying GUI). Runs on laptop too.

Emulates the game being run, so the client thinks the player is playing. Won't play games you don't own!

You also won't get any achievements too. Just a bunch of cards, if any card drops are left.

Read the disclaimer inside the program. (tl;dr: You can't blame me if your account gets blocked!)

## TODO
1. Use Qt as frontend, since HTML5 parser (nw.exe) has large overhead due to it being a web browser
2. Enable read from CSV or INI files so idling multiple games is possible
3. Automatic scheduling of game idling
4. Add practicality
5. Implement "Stop Idling" function
6. Fix UGUI script
